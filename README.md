# 🚦 India Road Accident Analytics Dashboard (2019–2023)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data across India to identify
state-wise risk patterns, major traffic violations, and dominant
collision types using Python and Power BI.

The dashboard provides a single-page executive view combining:
- Geographic risk distribution
- Yearly accident trends
- Human behavioral causes
- Collision pattern analysis

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV Data Sources

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
### Raw Data
- State-wise accident statistics
- Violation type data
- Collision type data

### Cleaned Data
- Standardized column names
- Year normalized into single column
- Removed nulls and inconsistencies
- Optimized for BI modeling

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)
- Renamed inconsistent state names
- Converted wide year columns into long format
- Removed duplicate and unnecessary rows
- Standardized metrics (Accidents, Fatalities, Injuries)
- Exported analysis-ready CSVs

---

## 📐 Data Modeling (Power BI)
- Star schema design
- Dimension tables: Year, State
- Fact tables: State, Violation, Collision
- One-to-many relationships

---

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
- Total Accidents, Fatalities, Injuries KPIs
- State-wise accident map
- Year-wise accident trend
- Top violations causing fatalities
- Accident distribution by collision type

---

## 🚀 Business Impact
- Identifies high-risk states for targeted road safety policies
- Highlights over-speeding as the leading cause of fatalities
- Supports data-driven decisions for accident prevention
